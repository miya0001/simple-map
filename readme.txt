Easy way to embed google map(s) using [gmaps.js](http://hpneo.github.com/gmaps/).

This plugin allows you to convert address into google maps like below:

`[map]San Francisco, California[/map]`

Another way, you can embed Google Map with url only like oEmbed.


You can also use coordinates, set width, height and zoom:

`[map lat="37.77493" lng="-122.41942"]
Text you would
like to appear
as a tooltip
goes here
[/map]`

In this case there will be a marker on the map with a tooltip appearing on click on the said marker.
You can use simple html as the tooltip content.
